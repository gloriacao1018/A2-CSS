1. File and folder organization:

- Main pages can go in in folder. no need for Website folder
- I recommend using lowercase names for folder and files 
    (just a recommendation, 
    you are not wrong)

2. HTML structure and metadata
- Add Additional metadata ( lower down in content)


3. Usage of appropriate elements, attributes and content
- Contact info can be a section not div
- "You use sub-sub-sub headings with no sub-sub heading. 
   Mind your h1,h2,h3 etc. It's a content hierarchy"
- <br> is not for layout
    *Because screen readers may announce <br> tags without any content in them, 
    it is considered bad practice to use them. Instead, use <p> elements along 
        with CSS to display the information
- Each article should be on an article tag
    - The <article> tag specifies independent, self-contained content.
        An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible 
        to distribute it independently from the rest of the site
